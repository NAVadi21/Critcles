# Important Word Extractor: Critcles:

A project that extracts important words from text using the Natural Language Processing techniques of preprocessing, stop word removal, and topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). It provides insights into the most significant words in a given text, aiding in understanding the key topics and themes present.

## üìù Description 

This project utilizes the `gensim` library and the NLTK corpus to preprocess the text by removing special characters, converting to lowercase, and removing stop words. It then applies LDA topic modeling to identify the most important words in the text. The extracted words are determined based on their frequency and relevance to the identified topics.
 
## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Preprocesses text by removing special characters and converting to lowercase.
- Removes stop words to focus on meaningful words. 
- Utilizes LDA topic modeling to identify important words.
- Provides customizable options for the number of topics and words to extract.
